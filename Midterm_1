## Problem2

(a) Explain what the difference between Gobal variables & Local variables

If a variable can be reached anywhere in the code is called a global variable. 
If a variable is known only inside the scope, we call it a local variable.

```python
def vowel(input_string):
    
    return_list = []                       # empty list to hold transformed letters
    vowels = {'a','e','i','o','u'}         # make set of vowels
    for char in input_string:              # go through string
        if char in vowels:                 # if the character is a vowel, make upper case
            return_list.append(char.upper())
        else:                              # if not, keep as is
            return_list.append(char)
    return_string = "".join(return_list)   # make list of characters into new string
    
    return return_string
 ```
