## Programming in Python and SQL 

- Introduction: This is a programming course in Python and SQL (Math167ps), which was taught by Dr. Martina Bremer at SJSU. This course is not just about Python and SQL programming. A main goal of this course is to improve our general programming and problem solving skills while reinforcing general statistical concepts.

- About the Course: 
  - Data types, control flow, object-oriented programming, and graphical user interface-driven applications. 
  - Relacitonal schemas, writing SQL queries, accessing and designing a database.
  - Performing database administration, and performing intermediate data base operations.

- Learning Objectives: 
  - Identify a problem and design a Python program to solve it.
  - Create executable Python code including loops, decision statments, and functions.
  - Manipulate data using Python libraries numpy and pandas.
  - Create meaningful graphs from data using Python library matplotlib.
  - Design and access a database using SQL queries.
