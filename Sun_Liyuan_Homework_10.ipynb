    "In this assignment, we're working with SQL. In particular, we'll be working with the Northwind database. This database contains sales data from a ficticious company called \"Northwind Traders\" which imports and exports specialty foods from around the world. These data have been created by Microsoft years ago and are used as the basis for various tutorials. \n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by re-creating the database on the MySQL server on your machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the file \"northwindmysql.sql\" from Canvas and save it somewhere on your machine under, say, \"MyPath/northwindmysql.com\"\n",
    "2. Log on to MySQL as root and run the following commands (I'm assuming that 'user' is an existing user that you have previously created). \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE DATABASE northwind;\n",
    "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON northwind.* to 'user'@'localhost';\n",
    "USE northwind;\n",
    "SOURCE MyPath/northwindmysql.sql;\n",
    "QUIT;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Then log on as the user and change the database to northwind. Look at all the tables you have (there should be nine of them).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "USE northwind;\n",
    "SHOW TABLES;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now you're ready to write SQL statements to answer the questions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative:** If you are not able to install MySQL on your machine, then you may try out your SQL code \n",
    "on the website [\"w3schools\" SQL tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/). This tutorial site is working with the Northwind database and can run SQL queries on this database that you enter directly into the website. However, the functionality of the website is somewhat restricted and you won't be able to run general queries (such as DESC statements or anything that requires more general privileges). But you should be able to run straightforward SELECT, JOIN, and GROUP BY statements. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The image file \"northwind-er-diagram.png\" (which you can also download from Canvas) shows an entity-relationship diagram for the Northwind database tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Heads-Up:** Variable names and data formats vary slightly between the data in \"northwindmysql.sql\" and on w3schools. Please clearly indicate for the grader in the cell below which version of the data you are working with. "
